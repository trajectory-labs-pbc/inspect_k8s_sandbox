    """The command to open the interactive shell an exec() runs inside.

    When a user is requested, only reach for `runuser` if the container is not
    already running as that user. `runuser` calls setgroups(2), which needs
    CAP_SETGID even when switching root -> root, so an unconditional wrapper
    makes every exec(user=...) fail in a container whose capabilities have been
    dropped. Skipping it is close to a no-op, but not exactly one: runuser also
    normalizes HOME, SHELL, USER, LOGNAME and PATH, which the skip path
    inherits from the container instead.

    The check runs in the container rather than here so that it costs no extra
    round trip. `sh -c` takes its script from argv, so stdin reaches whichever
    shell is exec'd unread, and the caller's protocol is unchanged.

    `user` may be a name or a uid, and the two must be compared against
    different things: testing a uid against `id -un` (or a name against `id -u`)
    would match an account merely *named* "0" against uid 0 and run the command
    as the wrong user. So only the applicable test is emitted.

    `id -un` reports only the first passwd name for a uid, so a second name for
    the same uid (root/toor) is not recognised and falls through to `runuser` --
    i.e. the previous behaviour, which is the safe direction.
