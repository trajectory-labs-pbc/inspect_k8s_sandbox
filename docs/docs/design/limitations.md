# Limitations

## Containers may restart

Containers may restart during an eval. This can be for several reasons including:

* The container terminates or crashes (PID 1 exited).
* The Pod is killed by Kubernetes (e.g. Out Of Memory).
* The Pod is rescheduled by Kubernetes (e.g. due to node failure or resource
  constraints).
* The Pod's [liveness
  probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#liveness-probe)
  fail.

Allowing containers to restart may be desirable:

* You may not want an agent to be able to deliberately crash its container (`kill 1`) in
  order to fail an eval if that would result in retrying the eval.
* If an agent causes your support infrastructure (like a web server) to crash or exceed
  memory limits, you may want it to restart.
* Your containers may depend on a certain startup order e.g. a web server assumes it can
  connect to a database which hasn't been scheduled or is not ready yet. In which case
  you would want the web server to enter a crash backoff loop until the database is
  available.

Sometimes, containers restarting is not desirable:

* If state is stored in-memory or on a non-persistent volume, it will be lost. E.g. an
  agent starts a long-running background process in its container or a web server stores
  session data in-memory.

If the eval attempts to directly interact with a container whilst it is restarting (e.g.
an agent tries to `exec()` a shell command), that sample of the eval will fail with a
suitable exception.

You can reduce the likelihood of Pod eviction by setting the resource limits and
requests of Pods such that you get a `Guaranteed` [QoS
class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)
which is the case by default in the [built-in Helm
chart](../helm//built-in-chart.md#resource-requests-and-limits).

You can reduce the impact of a container restarting by using persistent volumes.

The framework will issue a warning if a container restarts during an eval. If a
subsequent `exec()` fails after a detected restart, the restart is raised as the cause
regardless of mode. If you set the `restarted_container_behaviour` parameter to `raise`,
the eval will fail the sample immediately on detection, even if `exec()` has not failed.

??? question "Why not use Jobs over StatefulSets?"

    Instead of using
    [StatefulSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
    or
    [Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/),
    [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) could be used
    as the workload controller for the underlying Pods. This way, the Pod's
    `restartPolicy` can be configured as `Never` and the Job's `backoffLimit` as `0` in
    the cases where restarts are not desirable. However, this introduces some
    complexities:

    1. The `--wait` flag passed to `helm install` does not wait for Pods belonging to
    Jobs to be in a Running state. We'd have to implement our own waiting mechanism,
    possibly as a Helm post-install hook to avoid coupling the Python code to the Helm
    chart.

    2. We either need to ask developers to write their images in a way which won't crash
    if dependencies are not ready, or provide some way of expressing dependencies
    (e.g. a `dependsOn` field in the Helm chart) and ensuring the Pods are started in
    that order (e.g. with an init container which queries `kubectl`).

    3. The Python code would need a way of periodically checking (e.g. before every
    `exec()`) if any Pods in the release are in a failed state and won't be restarted,
    then fail that sample of the eval by raising an exception.


    What about bare Pods?

    When using bare Pods (i.e. not managed by a workload controller),
    `helm install --wait` will wait for all Pods to be in a Running state. However, if
    a Pod enters a failed state, it will not be restarted and `helm install` will wait
    indefinitely.


## Denied network requests behaviour

When Cilium denies a network request, it simply drops the packet.

If you're using the built-in Helm chart, [DNS lookups are
restricted](../security/network-access.md#dns-exfiltration) in addition to direct
network requests.

Therefore, when an agent tries to access a blocked resource via a client like `wget` or
`curl`, one of two things will happen:

1. The DNS lookup (if relevant) will time out. In this case, the client may error with
  "temporary failure in DNS resolution" or similar. If the client is not configured with
  a timeout (e.g. `host -r`), it may hang indefinitely until the tool call times out
  (see below).
2. If there is no DNS lookup required, the client will hang waiting for a response until
  its timeout (if it has one) is reached.

We recommend that any tools you define or use pass the `timeout` parameter (e.g.
`timeout=60`) in case the model runs a command that doesn't have a built-in timeout.


## Reverse DNS lookups aren't supported

When using the built-in Helm chart, reverse DNS lookups (i.e. looking up the hostname
from an IP) are not supported. This is because DNS lookups are restricted to prevent
[DNS exfiltration](../security/network-access.md#dns-exfiltration).

??? question "Why is ping slow?"

    Executing commands like

    ```sh
    ping victim
    ```

    where `victim` is another service's name will result in a reverse DNS lookup in
    addition to the forward DNS lookup. The reverse lookup will fail (which may add ~5s
    to the execution time of the command) but the forward lookup and subsequent command
    will succeed. `ping -n` disables reverse DNS lookups. Commands such as `curl` and
    `wget` do not perform reverse DNS lookups.


## Cilium's security measures prevent some exploits

Cilium imposes some sensible network security measures, described on their
[blog](https://cilium.io/blog/2020/06/29/cilium-kubernetes-cni-vulnerability/). Amongst
them is packet spoofing prevention. Any evals (e.g. Cyber misuse) which depend on the
agent spoofing packets may not work.

## The CoreDNS sidecar in the built-in Helm chart will use port 53

Evals which require the use of port 53 (e.g. a Cyber eval with a vulnerable DNS server)
will not work with the built-in Helm chart as each Pod has a CoreDNS sidecar which uses
port 53.

## Changes to `/etc/hosts` are ignored

The kubelet manages the `/etc/hosts` file. Any changes manually made to this file e.g.
in the Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
echo "127.0.0.1 my-domain.com" >> /etc/hosts
```

may be lost. If your aim is to make certain hostnames resolve to one of your services,
use the `additionalDnsRecords` field in the [built-in Helm
chart](../helm/built-in-chart.md#dns). Or, if using a custom Helm chart, consider using
the `hostAliases` field in the Pod spec
([docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/network/customize-hosts-file-for-pods/)).

## Transient errors are automatically retried

Transient network or infrastructure errors during `exec()`, `read_file()`, and `write_file()` are automatically retried (up to 5 times). These are typically caused by issues such as a node becoming unhealthy, a Pod being rescheduled, or the Kubernetes control plane being overloaded.

Note that retries cannot guarantee idempotency — if a command partially executed before the error, it may run again on retry.

## Must run as root to use the `user` parameter in `exec()` { #exec-user }

In Kubernetes, a container runs as a single user. The user can be specified in the
`values.yaml` file. For example, if using the [built-in Helm
chart](../helm//built-in-chart.md):

```yaml
services:
  my-service:
    image: alpine
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 1000
      runAsGroup: 1000
```

Therefore, executing commands as a different user to the one which the container was
started with is **not recommended**. Generally, specifying users in tool definitions can
result in undesirable coupling between your tools and sandbox.

That said, if you need to run commands as different users, the `user` parameter to
`exec()` is supported. To switch to a *different* user, you must run the container as
root, ensure that `runuser` is installed in the container, and keep `CAP_SETGID` — the
switch goes through `runuser`, which calls `setgroups(2)`. A container with
`capabilities: {drop: [ALL]}` therefore cannot switch users.

Naming the user the container already runs as needs none of those: that case skips
`runuser` entirely, so it works on a capability-dropped or non-root container, and on an
image with no `runuser` installed.

When the switch cannot be made, what happens depends on why. A container that is not
root, one that has had `CAP_SETGID` dropped, and one without `runuser` installed are all
properties of the environment rather than bad arguments: each logs a warning and returns
a failed `ExecResult`, so a caller which probes with a user can fall back to the
container's own user. Only naming a user that does not exist raises, since no fallback
makes an absent account work.

## Images are not automatically built, tagged or pushed

The process of building, tagging and pushing images is left to the user or other tooling
as it is highly dependent on your environment and practices.

## `TimeoutError` won't be raised on busybox images

The `timeout` binary on busybox images behaves differently, causing a 128 + 15 (SIGTERM)
= 143 exit code rather than a 124 exit code. This will result in a suitable `ExecResult`
being returned rather than raising a `TimeoutError`.

## Service and network names must be lower case alphanumeric

In the built-in Helm chart, service names (i.e. the keys in the `services` dict) must
match the case-sensitive regex `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$` e.g. `my-name` or
`123-abc`. Network names may additionally contain `.`. The Helm chart will fail to
install if this is not the case.

Both are also length-limited: 63 characters for a service name and 55 for a network
name. These are outer guards rather than usable budgets — each is combined with the
release name to form Kubernetes object names and label keys which are themselves capped
at 63 characters, so the practical limit is considerably shorter.
