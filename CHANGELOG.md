# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add per-service `x-inspect_k8s_sandbox.volumes` and `volumeMounts` compose
  extensions for Kubernetes volume types, including OCI image volumes, that Compose
  shorthand cannot express.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The CoreDNS sidecar now runs as UID/GID 65532 on a read-only root
  filesystem with only `NET_BIND_SERVICE`. A custom `corednsImage` must run under that
  context; set the new `corednsSecurityContext` if it cannot. The default image moves
  from CoreDNS 1.8.3 to a digest-pinned CoreDNS 1.14.6.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Service names, network names and `additionalDnsRecords` are now
  validated at install time and rejected with a schema error, rather than producing a
  release that fails later or resolves unexpectedly.
- The CoreDNS sidecar no longer serves its `ready` endpoint on port 8181, and refuses
  queries beyond 1000 concurrent.
- Raise an error when a conflicting `max_pod_ops` setting would otherwise be ignored.

## 2026-08-12 0.13.0

- Fix `write_file()` silently writing a truncated or empty file while reporting success
- `inspect sandbox cleanup k8s` (with no release name) now **exits non-zero** if any release fails to uninstall, rather than reporting `Complete.` and exiting 0. Releases which fail to uninstall are named, at end-of-task cleanup too, along with their namespace and the `inspect sandbox cleanup k8s <release>` command to retry them.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Sandbox pods created by the built-in Helm chart no longer mount
  Kubernetes service-account API tokens by default. Set
  `automountServiceAccountToken: true` only for sandboxes that require Kubernetes API
  access. Docker Compose users can set
  `x-k8s.automount_service_account_token: true`.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `serviceAccountName` now selects an existing ServiceAccount by
  default. Set `serviceAccountCreate: true` to retain automatic creation by the Helm
  chart.
- Add `service_account_name`, `service_account_create`, and
  `automount_service_account_token` to the top-level Docker Compose `x-k8s` extension.
- On Helm install failure, the raised error now includes pod diagnostics.
- Compose to HELM: Support the `security_opt` seccomp option (mapped to a pod `seccompProfile`) and ignore the unsupported `memswap_limit`. See [Compose to Helm](https://k8s-sandbox.aisi.org.uk/helm/compose-to-helm/) for details.
- The package and bundled `agent-env` chart versions are now unified, both jumping to
  `0.13.0` (intervening numbers are unused).

## 2026-06-25 0.6.1

- no changes - version bump only

## 2026-06-25 0.6.0

- Replace non-UTF-8 bytes in command output rather than throwing `UnicodeDecodeError`.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `allowDomains` egress is now restricted to ports 80/443, with the request identity enforced (TLS SNI on 443, HTTP `Host` on 80) rather than just the resolved IP. Wildcard entries require Cilium >= 1.18. New `allowDomainsPorts` opens other ports to those domains (IP-pinned; see `values.yaml`).
- Add a per-service `x-inspect_k8s_sandbox.resources` compose extension (alias `x-k8s`) for Kubernetes resource `requests`/`limits` (e.g. `ephemeral-storage`) that the `mem_limit`/`cpus`/`deploy.resources` shortcuts cannot express. Merged with those shortcuts; conflicts are rejected.
- Add optional `serviceAccountName` to the agent-env Helm chart for IRSA-based S3 access from sandbox pods.
- Honour Inspect sandbox config overrides (e.g. exec output size limits) that were previously ignored on Kubernetes.
- Recover from pod replacement or container restart instead of looping against the old pod, and raise typed `PodReplacedError` / `ContainerRestartedError` (was `RuntimeError`).
- Include the cause's type and message in `K8sError`'s string.
- Don't misreport a user command's own stderr as a `runuser` configuration error under `exec(user=...)`.
- Fix `exec(input=...)` and `write_file` failing with "Connection reset by peer" for large inputs (e.g. a ~28 MiB binary).
- Fix `TimeoutError`s in high-concurrency evals (many concurrent clusters).

## 2026-05-07 0.5.0

- Fixes for transient errors in sandbox operations
- Prefer kubeconfig over in-cluster config to preserve the configured namespace
- Configurable K8s client token refresh
- Add `INSPECT_K8S_DEFAULT_NAMESPACE` env var to override the default namespace
- Use `--wait=legacy` with Helm 4.x to avoid kstatus treating unscheduled pods as permanently failed
- Log a warning when no GPU node is available during `helm install`, so users know the wait is expected rather than a hang
- Pass comma-separated `key=value` labels from env var `INSPECT_HELM_LABELS` to `helm install --labels`

## 2026-03-04 0.4.0

- `INSPECT_SANDBOX_COREDNS_IMAGE` override
- Detect in-cluster Kubernetes config automatically, falling back to kubeconfig
- Add `max_pod_ops` to `K8sSandboxEnvironmentConfig`
- Declare K8sSandboxEnvironment as Docker-compatible (supports `inspect-harbor` and Docker Compose/Dockerfile config files)
- Pass sample metadata as Helm `--set-string` values
- Extend compose-to-helm converter: support `allow_entities`, ignore `networks[].internal`, default `networks[].driver` to `bridge`
- Add `inspectSampleUUID` label to pods
- Network policy: also allow node-local DNS cache
- Support initContainers

## 2025-12-09 0.3.0

- Increase files open limit if necessary
- Migrate to uv
- Add (ignored) concurrency param to exec
- Support `network_mode: none` in Docker Compose files
- Support `x-default` service key in Docker Compose files
- **Breaking**: When converting multi-service Docker Compose files without an explicit
  default, the first service (in YAML order) is now renamed to `default`. This ensures
  consistent default service resolution regardless of Kubernetes pod ordering.
- **Breaking**: Add validation for null values in Helm values files (Helm 4 silently filters out null values from maps during template processing, which can cause unexpected behavior)

## 2025-09-25 0.2.0

- First release to Pypi
- Ignore `x-local` key in Docker Compose files (Inspect-specific extension).
- Enhanced `additionalResources` to support full Helm templating.
- Support `user` parameter on `K8sSandboxEnvironment.exec()` (only when container is running as root and `runuser` is installed).
- Support `user` parameter on `K8sSandboxEnvironment.connection()` (returns `SandboxConnection`).
- Add `SandboxConnection` support for human agent baselining and connecting to a sandbox for debugging.
- Add support for specifying a kubeconfig context name in K8sSandboxEnvironmentConfig.
- Add automatic translation of Docker Compose files to Helm values files.
- Handle cancellation of evals (either manually or due to an error) such that Helm releases are uninstalled.
- Increase default Helm install timeout from 5 to 10 minutes.
- For "helm install timeout" errors, add link to docs within and include instructions on increasing timeout within the error message.
- Ignore "release not found" errors when uninstalling Helm charts (expected when helm release was not successfully installed).
- Prevent DNS exfiltration attacks by limiting which domains can be looked up (when using the built-in Helm chart).
- If a namespace is not includes in the kubeconfig context, default to a namespace named "default".
- Add `CLUSTER_DEFAULT` magic string for `runtimeClassName` which will remove the field from the pod spec.
- Add ignored `timeout_retry` parameter to `exec()` method.
- Always capture the output of `helm uninstall` so that errors can contain meaningful information.
- Add support for `inspect sandbox cleanup k8s` command to uninstall all Inspect Helm charts.
- Remove use of Inspect's deleted `SANDBOX` log level in favour of `trace_action()` and `trace_message()` functions.
- Initial release.
